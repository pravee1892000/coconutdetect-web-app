# coconutdetect-web-app
This project focuses on detecting coconuts into three maturity stages—Tender, Middle, and Dry—using YOLOv8 instance segmentation models. The primary goal is to develop an automated system for coconut maturity detection, which can be beneficial in agriculture, quality assessment, and supply chain optimization.
